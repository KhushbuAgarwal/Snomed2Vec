things to do : 

> attention mechanism add and check 

> test out dense representations by adding a dense layer before lstm 

> think of regularization as a parameter for training 
  -- try to normalize the regularized term

> build the hierarchy

> have to fix the training data as constant canâ€™t use random stuff anymore
> have to build the hierarchy

> check with svm (is there significant difference) and other classifiers
